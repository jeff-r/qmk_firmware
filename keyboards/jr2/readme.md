Jeff Roush's keyboard
======================

## First version of my keyboard to not run on a Microchip PIC.

I'm calling this version of the firmware jr2.

The hardware of the matching keyboard is the latest iteration of my keyboards, version something-or-other. But the firmware is version 2.

The keyboard currently runs on a [Teensy 2.0 board](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy.html).

## Building

Run `make` from this directory.

### Default
To build with the default keymap, simply run `make default`.

```
$ make default
```
## Programming

I'm using the [teensy_loader_cli](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader_cli.html) to program the Teensy.

On my Ubuntu 16.10 box, I did have to update the udev rules, as per the teensy documentation. I then built teensy_loader_cli, and added it to the path.

Then, put the teensy in program mode and run the `program` script in this directory.

## Notes

This was shamelessly copied from the Bantam44 keyboard. So keymap.c specifies three keymaps, but I'm currently only using one.

The keycodes are defined in tmk_core/common/keycode.h.
